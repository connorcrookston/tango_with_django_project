# tango_with_django_project

Coursework submission for WAS 10/04/2022.

note that the reason my commits are so close together is due to the fact I had already completed the project on another repository, however I did not commit at the end of each chapter, so I had to redo it! 

My original repository: https://github.com/connorcrookston/Django-Uni-Project
